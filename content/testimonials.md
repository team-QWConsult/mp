  - name: Steve G
    title: Buyer at Vanila Park Apartments
    quote: You were professional, punctual and listened to my needs instead of selling me what you already had listed. You worked within my budget and were sensitive to the fact that I wanted to get good value for my money versus upselling me. You have a good understanding of the financial fundamentals of buying property, i.e. beyond the emotional decision around such a large purchase.
    summary: professional, punctual and listened to my needs
