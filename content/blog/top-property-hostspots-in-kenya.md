Juja is ideal for those seeking long-term gains through land and residential property investment.

### 3. Thika

Thika is an established industrial and commercial town about 40 kilometers from Nairobi. It benefits from a strong manufacturing sector and improved transport links. Property prices remain reasonable, offering investors affordable entry points with promising future growth prospects.

### 4. Syokimau

### 5. Kiambu Town

Kiambu Town, part of the Greater Nairobi Metropolitan Area, has experienced a boom in residential and commercial developments.
